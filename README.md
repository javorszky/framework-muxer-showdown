## Scaffolding

Makefile has a docker build that produces a utility image with `gci`, `golangci-lint`, and `mockery` in it. The docker compose file then uses that image to run the various tools, so you don't need to have any of them installed locally.

### Commands

* `make test`: runs `go test ./...`.
* `make lint`: runs golangci-lint with the configs from the [.golangci.yaml](.golangci.yaml) file.
* `make lintfix`: runs gci on all `*.go` files recursively minus the `vendor` directory.
* `make mocks`: runs mockery to generate mocked interfaces in all go files recursively minus the `vendor` directory with config from the [.mockery.yaml](.mockery.yaml) file.
